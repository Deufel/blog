# CSS (Work in Progress)

A minimal custom CSS file based on slight modifications of [OpenProps UI](https://open-props-ui.netlify.app/) built with the custom css variables from [OpenProps](https://open-props.style/); and icons from [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) and [arcticons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/arcticons/)

## Demo

## Overview

This project is a flat-file CSS implementation that adapts and slightly changes styles from two open-source CSS libraries. It is intended for lightweight, simple use cases without the overhead of a full framework.

update: July 2025 These components are increasingly being built intended for use with [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/).

## Usage

Download or link the `styles.css` file into your project; but be aware this is not minified or optimized for production use.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deufel/css/styles.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deufel/css/theme.js"></script>

```
